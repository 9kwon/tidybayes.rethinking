Description: Facilitates composing data for and extracting samples from Bayesian samplers (JAGS, Stan, ...) in a tidy data format.
    Also provides some miscellaneous functions helpful for running Bayesian models, such as a ggplot2 function for easy eye plots
    of posteriors (aka raindrop plots or violin plots).
