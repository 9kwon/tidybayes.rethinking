Description: Facilitates composing data for and extracting samples from
    Bayesian samplers (JAGS, Stan, ...) in a tidy data format. Also provides some
    miscellaneous functions helpful for running Bayesian models, such as a ggplot2
    function for easy eye plots of posteriors (aka raindrop plots or violin plots).
