# tidybayes.rethinking: Extend tidybayes to work with the rethinking package <img id="tidybayes_logo" src="man/figures/logo.svg" align="right" />

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mjskay/tidybayes.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mjskay/tidybayes)

_Matthew Kay, University of Michigan, <mjskay@umich.edu>_

This package extends the [tidybayes](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes) R package to support models from Richard McElreath's [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) package. It is separate from the core `tidybayes` package because `rethinking` is not currently available on CRAN.


## Installation

If you haven't already, install the `rethinking` package per the instructions on [the rethinking page](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking), and install `tidybayes` per the instructions on [the tidybayes page](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes).

Then, install `tidybayes.rethinking` from github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjskay/tidybayes.rethinking")
```


## Examples

See the [tidybayes](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes) documentation, or check out `vignette("tidybayes")` for a variety of examples.


## Feedback and issues

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and issues! Contact me at <mjskay@umich.edu>. If you have found a bug, please file it 
[here](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes/issues/new) with minimal code to reproduce the issue.

`tidybayes` grew out of helper functions I wrote to make my own analysis pipelines tidier. Over time it has expanded to cover more use cases I have encountered, but I would love to make it cover more!
