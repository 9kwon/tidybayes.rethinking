- write extract_samples_long for other samplers
- write examples in docs and README
- make a function add_samples(df, i, ...), where i is an index extracted by gather_samples(m, ...) that should be of the same length as df
- replace ldply with map_df, llply with map (?)
- replace remaining hacked-together NSEs with lazyeval
- make sure all args on NSE functions start with "."
