- write extract_samples_long for other samplers
- write examples in docs and README
- make a function add_samples(df, i, ...), where i is an index extracted by gather_samples(m, ...) that should be of the same length as df
- make gather_samples accept multiple specifications and bare variables (e.g. b instead of b[])
- replace ldply with map_df
- replcae left joins with inner joins where necessary
- replace hacked-together NSE with lazyeval
- make sure all args on NSE functions start with "."
