\title{Point and interval estimates for tidy sample data}
\usage{
point_interval(data, ..., prob = 0.95, point = mean, interval = qi)

mean_qi(data, ..., prob = 0.95)

mode_qi(data, ..., prob = 0.95)

qi(x, prob = 0.95)

hdi(x, prob = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame (or grouped data frame as returned by \code{\link{group_by}})
that contains samples to summarize.}

\item{...}{Bare column names or expressions that, when evaluated in the context of
\code{data}, represent samples to summarise.}

\item{prob}{Probability to use for generating intervals}

\item{point}{Point estimate function, which takes a vector and returns a single
value, e.g. \code{\link{mean}}, \code{\link{median}}, or \code{\link{Mode}}.}

\item{interval}{Interval estimate function, which takes a vector and a probability
(\code{prob}) and returns a two-element vector representing the lower and upper
bound of an interval; e.g. \code{\link{qi}}, \code{\link{hdi}}}

\item{x}{vector to summarise (for interval functions: \code{qi} and \code{hdi})}
}
\description{
Translates samples in a (possibly grouped) data frame into a point and
interval estimate (or set of point and interval estimates, if there are
multiple groups in a grouped data frame).
}
\details{
\code{mean_qi}, \code{mode_qi}, etc are short forms for 
\code{point_interval(..., point = mean, interval = qi)}, etc.

\code{qi} yields the quantile interval (also known as the percentile interval or
equi-tailed interval).

\code{hdi} yields the highest-density interval (also known as the highest posterior
density interval).
